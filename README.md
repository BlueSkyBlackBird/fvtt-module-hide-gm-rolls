# Foundry VTT - Hide GM Rolls

![Release](https://github.com/sPOiDar/fvtt-module-hide-gm-rolls/workflows/Release/badge.svg)

This module allows sanitizing public GM rolls by hiding formulas and breakdowns from players, showing just the total instead. It can also hide private GM rolls from players entirely.
